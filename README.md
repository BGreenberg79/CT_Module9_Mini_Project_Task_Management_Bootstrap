# Mock Task Management App completed with Bootstrap
## Programmed by Benjamin Greenberg
Mini Project for Coding Temple

___
## Project Overview
This project progresses my knowledge of Hypertext Markup Language \(HTML\) by using the Bootstrap framework to cohesively and efficiently style a mock task management app. This website has a working and responsive navbar that can work on all devices to jump from page to page on my website. It is built around forms pages that create tasks, register accounts, and authenticate log ins; as well as cards and carousels on the home page, task dashboard, task detail pages. I effectively use bootstrap's grid classes to appropriately configure my content on all sizes of screens.
